This page focuses on strategic interaction in multi-agent systems facing intelligent adversaries. My research explores geometric evasion tactics, dynamic role-switching using differential games, and methods for exploiting opponent learning through strategic deception.

## Highly Evolved Heterogeneous Multi-robotic Fleet

In critical scenarios like search and rescue, teams must simultaneously map unknown areas, navigate complex terrain, and maintain communication. Achieving these diverse objectives is a significant challenge, particularly in environments without reliable GPS or communication infrastructure. This project deploys a fleet of robots equipped with a versatile, multi-sensor payload for advanced perception and mapping. My efforts in this project pertain to operating this fleet as a convoy, strategically "peeling" off robots to create a communication relay network back to the base station. This technique enhances operational range and situational awareness while minimizing the cognitive load on human operators in hazardous conditions.
