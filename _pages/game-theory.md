This page is primarily concerned with collaboration in multi-agent systems in the presence of obstacles and constraints. Collaborative Multi-agent systems is a multi-faceted domain with multiple research thrusts. What follows is a brief summary of such research. 

## Handling a Vision-guided Adversary

My research focuses on developing robust algorithms that allow teams of robots to coordinate and complete tasks safely, even when facing intelligent adversaries or challenging, unknown environments. I explore game-theoretic principles and distributed optimization to create strategies that are resilient to failures and external disruptions.

This approach allows the text to flow naturally around the image. You can write as much or as little as you want, and the layout will adjust automatically. It's much more flexible than fixed columns.

Key publications in this area include work on [robotic convoying](/publication/2025-robotic-convoying) and multi-target defense games.
